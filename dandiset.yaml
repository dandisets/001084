description: Neural population dynamics relevant to behavior vary over multiple spatial
  and temporal scales across three-dimensional volumes. Current optical approaches
  lack the spatial coverage and resolution necessary to measure and manipulate naturally
  occurring patterns of large-scale, distributed dynamics within and across deep brain
  regions such as the striatum. We designed a new micro-fiber array approach capable
  of chronically measuring and optogenetically manipulating local dynamics across
  over 100 targeted locations simultaneously in head-fixed and freely moving mice,
  enabling the investigation of cell-type- and neurotransmitter-specific signals over
  arbitrary 3D volumes at a spatial resolution and coverage previously inaccessible.
  We applied this method to resolve rapid dopamine release dynamics across the striatum,
  revealing distinct, modality-specific spatiotemporal patterns in response to salient
  sensory stimuli extending over millimeters of tissue. Targeted optogenetics enabled
  flexible control of neural signaling on multiple spatial scales, better matching
  endogenous signaling patterns, and the spatial localization of behavioral function
  across large circuits.
